# Kotlin Core Concepts from Beginner to Advance
This course is for anyone who want to learn kotlin from scratch. We will start learning kotlin by first installing the IDE intellij idea and then we will run our first program .Then we move to the basics of kotlin that what is a variable, loops ,conditions ,data structures etc after that we will learn the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming like inheritance,polymorphism,abstraction etc and then we will move to the next section that is Java and Kotlin so we will learn how both(Java and Kotlin) have interoperability .So now you must ask the question that why kotlin over java  so here are the few reasons.

### Why kotlin over java
Kotlin fixes a series of issues that Java suffers from.
1. Null references controlled by the system
